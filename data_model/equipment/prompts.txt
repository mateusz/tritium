Let's add a function here for getting the amount of technician-days required to research this technology. This should scale proportionally to rank, and proportionally to how many types of rare elements are required to produce. 

The number should be per technician, so the lowest number should be around 700 - for the basic 100-person technician-level research team this means the research will be completed in 7 days. Give it a try now.
