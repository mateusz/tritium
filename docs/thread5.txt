You can download it for free on this emulation site. Activision have granted

Once I discovered that war was triggered by building a certain number of
stations I started over (after finding out what resources are required to
build drones). I built as many stations as I could without causing
conflict, then I let the computer run for a day or two stockpiling the
necessary amount of resources so that when I triggered war I could produce
enormous amounts of drones. Tedious, but it worked! Once I cleared them
out of our space, I made the jump to the closest star system and discovered
that I should have sent more warships to protect my first base out there.

Then I sold my A2000. :-(

Okay, only one problem though. How does one create a save game disk if using
WinUAE to play the game? It does not want to format a blank .adf file, so it
must be trying to do something unusual to the disk

Does anyone have an adf of the save disk? :)

A few tips then:
1. Always use the your highest ranking crews in battles.
2. Stock up on a LOT of resources before colonizing the system that
starts the methanoid war.
3. Never try to defend bases in other star systems, thats a futile
and unnecessary task. You only need one base in each remote galaxy to get
that "thing". When you get it, leave the poor base to die.

It still takes a LONG time to win this game.

A Warlord gives IOS drones the same combat strength as SSG Drones.
Considering that the former are much cheaper to build, this makes
defending other start systems much more viable.

Also using an unmanned carrier just long enough to launch a PTL
or two before running can soften up an attacking force quite nicely
for another IOS carrier to deal with. This can be a usefull tactic
early in the game when IOS drones are tough to come buy and
experienced crews even tougher, or when you're caught in the middle
of setting up a base's defenses.

I strongly disagree with this one. The same "the Methanoids attack the
same base twice" and "the Methanoids usually attack the last captured base,
then coreward" rules apply here, making defenses fairly easy to set up.
The production gained from the additional bases, however, makes the effort
well worth it. By games end your war machine should be producing *hundreds*
of IOS drones above what is needed for defense (which will eventually be
none, once the B-laser is available). The last times I played, I had
2 tag team IOS carriers blitz through the last 3 star systems, pausing
only to capture each base, teleport over more drones, and continue the
process. The only lags were the initial base capture and getting the
crews trained to Warlord status and on site to man the IOS ships, not
a major delay if you set these up for your next system in advance.

Well, I thank everyone for the strategy tips, but if I can't build the save game
disk, it is all for naught! :)

Quick rehash for anyone who missed the original post: I'm running Deuteros on
WinUAE, so I can't create a save game disk. Can it be done? Does it already
exist as an ADF?

Um, you lost me. Don't you need an SSG to go from system to system, and an IOS
in the system?

I like to think that was my fault. ;-)

I bought the first game in the series and had it finished after 18 hours. I wrote
a letter and sent it to Microprose (I believe they were the publisher) complaining
about how short the game was. Deuteros was taking WAY longer, so I thought the
authors were getting back at me. :-)

If all you need is a 'blank formatted disk' to save on, then nip over to
www.amigaemulation.com and download the blank disk images there. Select
SAVE GAME, then 'insert' the blank disk. Works for a lot of my visitors.

Good luck!

We know, but the conversation thread got sidetracked. This is one of
those games that the mere mention gets people to post old stories about.

Good luck, I can't help you here (I played the game on the real thing).
The thought of playing Deuteros again on my Pentium III laptop, however,
has me quite intrigued.

Prejudice Torpedo Launcher. Nifty little gadget that blows a load
of fuel and (if timed right) nails a good number of enemy drones in
combat (as well as several of yours - or more, if your luck or timing
is lacking). Not as effective as the B-laser, but at least its mobile.

As I stated, there is a minor (usually *very* minor) delay of using a
SSG to take the first base in each system, and one to haul along a crew
for the IOS carriers (take the other crew from the SSG before it heads
home). Once that first base is taken, teleport the IOS components and
drones, assemble them and repeat the process. If your SSG is waiting ready
for the next system assault as your IOS ships finish the prior one, the
timing flow is almost seamless. Bottom line is you should only need to use
a SSG drone carrier once per system outside to Sol system. Besides,
maintaining more than 1 SSG carrier (and even that, if you keep it
manned) is just asking for a Warlord to go pirate.

And on that note, anyone figure out what the hell you do once you've
got that bastard locked away ? Nothing else happened when I played,
no messages, nothing. Always wanted to "find out why" he turned traitor.

It had me intrigued too! It looks good playing in a window on my NT laptop. Sadly,
it isn't meant to be.

Thank you to those who supplied the save disk in .adz format. Unfortunately,
Deuteros still does not like the disk. I guess WinUAE is expecting disks to conform
to a certain layout and the Deuteros save disk must be using its own. Time to find
an A500! :)

Correct. I had two fully equipped SCG fleets. There are two Methanoid
bases in the Proxima system; I hit them both at the same time in order to
get the hyperdrive as soon as possible, then started churning out Warlords.

The only snag here is that you don't have the PTL early in the game. :-)
You only get it when you have cleared another system of Methanoids.

Having two fleets helps, though. Have the first fleet engage, knock off a
few Methanoid drones, disengage the first fleet, engage the second fleet.
Battles are tests of strength, pure and simple - your full strength second
fleet *will* beat the weakened Methanoid fleet, assuming a Warlord commands it.

Moreover, note that a Methanoid attack takes four days to capture a base. It
also takes your fleet four days to get from one planet to another. So one
fleet can actually defend up to three planets - the one it's at and its two
adjacent neighbours.

Also, the more bases you have, the more resources you get, and resources is
everything. Especially titanium and aluminium.

I had one SCG filled with cryo pods carrying Warlords, which accompanied the
SCG attack fleets and dropped off Warlords when needed. Meanwhile, I always
had three commanders in training - one on the Earth surface shuttle, one on
the Moon surface shuttle, and one in an IOS moving between Earth and Moon.

Further to my previous post, the copy I was forwarded was the image you posted to a.b.w.a
(thanks!).

It does not list any existing saved games, nor does Deuteros recognize the disk. I tried
a copy of Awesome that I have as .adz files and it loads fine, so I know I don't have a
configuration issue with gzip. I'm not aware of any other parameters I can change re:
floppy access, so I think I am pretty much sunk. The hunt for an A500 continues! :-)

Thanks for all your help!

The only things I can think of to try to narrow down the problem:
1) Can WinZIP extract the disk without complaining about the archive?
Rename it to a .Z (gzip) file, and try to extract with WinZip... if
WinZIP complains, we know the disk-image has been corrupted on its
way to you. (Unlikely, I know, but worth testing for paranoias sake. :)

2) Have you tried to get hold of, say, Shanes ADZ of Deuteros itself?
Maybe you have a version hacked by different people, and they hacked
around with the save-disk format as well, making it incompatible with
other cracks? (Or yours is an incomplete hack of Deuteros where the
save-game stuff just plain wont work?) ...Have you verified that it's
the same crack?

3) Are you using the same version of the same emulator as Shane? (With
the same preferences settings?) Maybe there are emulation issues
with the Save-disk code?

I don't have an Amiga-emulator, or this game. ...But from what I've
heard, those are the only things I can think could be wrong. :/ It's
got me stumped.

Winzip opened the .z and produced an .adf file. The .adf does not work
either. :-(

A possibility. I downloaded my copy from

The game appears to run just fine, until I can't stay awake any longer...

One would hope that an adf is an adf. This would represent a serious set back
to the development of the emulator otherwise... :-)
