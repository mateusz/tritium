So I want us to jointly develop a data model for a Deuteros amiga game remake.

I have provided you with context files in the form of game manual @manual_orig, two user-written walkthroughs @manual1.txt and @manual2.txt, as well as a summary from wikipedia@summary.txt. There is also @planetdata.csv file which contains a csv dump of player-created list of systems, planets and resources available in each of these sites.

Extract all possible game entities from these files as a markdown multi-level list. At this point I just need a reliable list.

---

Ok, now based on game_entities, figure out a list of abstract base classes of objects. So for example, I want an abstract `base` but don't want specifically `mars_base`. Produce the list into abstract_entities.md

---

Now extract just the top-level entities from @abstract_entities.md and post here.

---

Cool. Now construct an entity-relationship chart making sure the entities you listed above are connected with has-one, has-many and many-many relationships. Print this into entity_relationships.md
