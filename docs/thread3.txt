I am a big fan of the game Deuteros. I have a question that only the
diehard Amiga game fans can answer. After you boot up Deuteros, go in
the disk utility section and play the demo. You will notice that
there is a huge IOS if you look closely when the demo is bringing up
the regular IOS. The regular IOS (spaceship) looks something like
this: (===[ You have: the crew pod, three places to mount various
payloads and the engine. The other IOS I saw in the demo looked
something like: (======[ I believe it is used to travel between
solar systems. Another thing I noticed in the demo is a "Balance
Everything" screen in which the demo has a pulsing "laser" at the top
and appears to be using a "beam" or something to transfer various
minerals, etc from it's various orbital stations. Also, after you
play the demo and start a new game, you will notice a "Tachyon
Transmitter" in your development screen! If you try to develop it
though, it will only go to 10% and no further. I have beat the game,
but only from destroying all the Methanoids in our solar system. It
just says game over and ends. I think it is possible to travel
outdide the galaxy though. Also, can anyone tell me what the
lightswitch does on the recruiting screen? Hopefully there is a
master gamer out there that can shed some light on this.

PS-The game is a copy that sayd "Cracked by Black Monks" upon booting.
I would try to disassemble this, but it is written with the track disk
device and not a dos disk. Any hints, tips or secrets anyone can
reveal would be much appreciative.

Yes I have seen this version, it's a sort of demo I think. I bought the orinal
off a friend a few years ago which lets you expand beyond our solar system.
I think also that the versio you have doesn't show a little picture of
what you are building in the construction screen. The large IOS is the ship
used to travel beyond our system, laser thing was a matter transmitter for
transferring stuff between stations without having to transfer it with the IOS.
Of course it had to be constructed first. The tachyon transmitter is what
you must build to finish the game. Every time you conquer a system you get a
message from an uknown alie race informing you where to find another part, which
you can grab out of orbit with a grapple. once you have all the parts the game
ends. It's actual use I don't know.

Reckon so. Ruined the surprise for yourself now, haven't you? :)
I managed to play all the way through that several times without
noticing that little flicker..

Er, also, yes.

Hardly, but you can go a few light-years. You're not winning the
game properly though, you see, in Civilization terms you're just
conquering the planet instead of getting a fully-stocked colony
ship to the stars whilst the fawning natives give you all their
gold and the occasional city. What you need to be doing is
capturing some Methanoid technology instead of blowing it up.

It is my considered opinion that it turns the light on and off. :)

You do have an original as well, of course.
Or at least you did at some point, but it died?

I don't remember the term "Tachyon Transmitter". From the rest of Hans'
article, it seems to be the device that the non-Methanoid aliens give you,
one piece at a time - you get one piece in each star system when you have
cleared that system of Methanoids. You get the big ship *before* you get
the transmitter - in fact, you need the big ship if you're going to get
any parts of the transmitter! The big ship is the Star Class Galleon, and
you get to develop and build it when you have cleared the Sun system of
Methanoids, assuming you have the full game and not just a demo.

>Perhaps someone knows this: is it actually possible to capture the pirate
>captain?

Yes. In due time, your head of research will design a prison pod, which
you must build. You can't control the pirate ship but you can see where it
is going; arrange to have a prison pod and tool module at that place when
the pirate arrives. Also make sure the spacedock is clear so the pirate
can dock at the station. First thing to do is remove the pirate from the
bridge, the same way that you remove any other crew from the bridge of one
of your ships. Now remove (at least) one of the cargo modules. Fit a
tool module, fit a prison pod onto the tool module, then click on the
prison pod. It works much the same way as a cryo pod, so put the pirate
into the prison pod the same way you put anyone into a cryo pod.

Then click the right mouse button. You only have a second or two to do
this before the pirate jumps out of the prison pod. Clicking the right
button locks the pod, and the pirate can not then escape.

I had a couple of dirty tricks involving the pirate. Before you get the
prison pod, you can still remove the pirate from the bridge of the ship,
then you can mess with the ship's modules. I removed the lot. That
meant he could not steal any of my stuff, and I got a bunch of free cargo
modules. Once I had captured the pirate, I removed all other modules and
most of its fuel, then sent it to the nearest Methanoid base. You can't
kill the pirate yourself so I let the Methanoids do the honours. :-)

Another Deuteros Question

Hi there,

i`ve got another litte different problem, but i suppose some of you
could help me.

I own an Amiga 3000 and Deuteros doesn`t run on it - or at least
doesn`t run at 100%.

Playing the game directly is not possible. Using T.U.D.E it works almost
fine. It runs up till Earth City and you could start playing, BUT its
impossible to access the floppy drive correctly.
The second floppy (df1:) ist obviously not known to Deuteros, too.

Earlier made game disks (long time ago) are not being recognoised as
saved games disks. Testing them on an old A500 indicates me that they
work as usual. Formating new game disks doesn`t work as well. About
five head-ticks and an error comes up. Did I mention that the disks
were AmigaOS formatted (WITH verify) and no error occured?


Has anybody an idea what is going wrong there?


The T.U.D.E. Options are as follows:
Degrade
OSPatchOld
HardReset
CHIPSET=OLD
VBASE=ZERO
CHIPMEM=1024k
CACHES=NONE

My A3000 has a built-in Double-Speed Disk Drive. (for DDs & HDs)
This might be of interest.

BTW: I own the original, but never saw the demo. Would someone
tell where I can get it?

regards,
Helmut

In article <64ukev$j1i$1...@av2.rz.fh-augsburg.de>,

I have now found a version that seems to have an AGA fix built in. This
version boots fine, but it is real jerky. Let me explain...lets say that
the mouse pointer is in the center of the screen. If you move the mouse
pointer to the left of the screen, it stays in the center of the screen
for about 2 seconds and then moves to the left of the screen. Also if
you watch the spinning globe icon on the earth city screen, it will spin,
stop, spin again, etc. It is like there is some internal interrupt that
is interfearing with the game or something. Has anyone else had this
problem?

In article <880665...@dejanews.com>,

I found out the cure. I just coldbooted the A3000 with Deuteros disk 1
in df0. No more jerking. Ran smooth as everything. Now if I can just
figure out what to do after getting the Star Class Galleons. :|

In the original game there is no demo.

You are correct. It travels between stars. It is called a Star Class Galleon.

The balance everything is just that. You can share every resource between
stations. Yes, it is a "transporter" like in Star Trek.
The Tachyon Transmitter will only develop if you have the proper knowledge
i.e. does your main research know about it.

You can't travel outside the galaxy but to other stars.

Nothing is listed in the instructions.

I would again suggest you get a REAL version. Only about $5 - $10. Surely you
can afford that.

Attached to this is a Lotus WKS file. You should be able to import it to any
DECENT spreadsheet program. ProCalc, MaxiPlan......

It lists the Stars, Planets, moons, and has blanks for minerals found on the
planets or moons.

Well, to begin with you warp out there and kick some
serious Methanoid posterior.. Have you started that yet?

Well, I have sent a SCG out to Proximia and I have a pilot, but when I try
to activate even the first of eight sections for the orbital station, it
tells me that a crew is required to activate this payload and must be
ranked pilot. How wierd. I also tried using a grapple, a SCG with a DFCC
and orbital battle drones. I dunno what I am doing wrong. Is the first
