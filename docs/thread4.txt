In Deutros I have built 4 orbital factories and I have met the geezers from Jupiter so I now have axxess to Helium. Can someone tell me what happens next? I visited Saturn and was warned that those nasty Methane Breathing geezers were planning to kill me, but now research has come to a grinding halt and I cannot seem to progress. Any Ideas?

Sorry - I don't recall the details, but in the absence of any other help,
I seem to remember that as you continued to expand one of your colonies
stumbles on something that leads to more breakthroughs. Its certainly
worth keeping your Marines as highly trained as possible! :)

Anybody else got a better memory?

All the best,

First you're mixing your games, Angus. There are no Marines in Deuteros,
just pilots and fighter drones. Are you maybe thinking Supremacy?

IIRC (been a while for me as well), what you want to do is head back to
their alien base orbiting Jupiter. When you do the base will have been set
to self destruct. There are two switches, one on either side of the self
destruct unit. Flip them. Leave... Quickly! When you get back home your
scientists will replicate the self destruct and then eventually give you
the ability to make fighter drones and the computer required to controll
them. I HIGHLY recomend you stock pile large amounts of elments before you
do this as once the Aliens attack you are in for a hell of a fight and
will need the elements for making drones.

Marines are the crews of your spacecraft in Deuteros. :-)

But first, you'll need to have researched the IOS Drone and DFCC; you'll need
to have built at least one DFCC and at least 200 Drones; and you'll need a
crew rated Admiral in charge of the flagship (an otherwise ordinary IOS fitted
with a DFCC). I prefer to make sure I win the battle by having two fleets. :-)

Hmm... this must be a tactic I haven't heard of. I thought any ship which
approaches a Methanoid base gets attacked, and only gets to dock with the
base once it has defeated the defending drones. Also, the first time I try
to capture a Methanoid base, the levers don't work - they only move after
Research has figured out how to duplicate the mechanism. As for the drones
and DFCC, there are two ways to get Research to invent them, depending on how
the war started. If you build a sixth orbital factory, the Methanoids get
upset and declare war. Research then says "Those Methanoids can't scare us"
and invents the drones and DFCC. Alternatively, if you have no more than 5
orbital factories and keep trading with Jupiter, they eventually decide to
attack anyway. Your friend on Jupiter gives you a prototype laser, which
Research will investigate and find to be useless, then they devise the drones
and DFCC.

As for helium, you won't need that until a lot later. You *will* need lots
of titanium and aluminium. Keep this in mind when deciding where to put your
orbital factories!

Hah! You think not, eh?!!! ;)

Check the screen with the three doors for recruiting new personel. They
are listed, Resaerch, Product and Marines.

I thank you.


>just pilots and fighter drones. Are you maybe thinking Supremacy?

I'm thinking of _my_ supremacy, yes. :)

Erm... Not on my version. It says Research, Product, Serfs. ;-)

Do you have to gloat? :-)

But I have so few opportunities. :)

Yeah, me too... it was so refreshing to see a serf joke that didn't come from
me or Angus :-)
