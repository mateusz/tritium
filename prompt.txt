So I want us to jointly develop a data model for a Deuteros amiga game remake.

I have provided you with context files in the form of a user-written walkthrough @manual1.txt which contains a complete list of various entities.

Extract all possible game entities from these files as a markdown multi-level list. At this point I just need a reliable list added to docs/game_entities.md

---

Ok, now based on game_entities.md, figure out a list of abstract classes of objects. So for example, I want an abstract `base` but don't want specifically `mars_base`. Produce the list into docs/abstract_entities.md.

Additionally, I want you to add entity relationships to these abstract entities. Specifcally, as a markdown list, add all has_many and has_one relationships between these abstract classes.
