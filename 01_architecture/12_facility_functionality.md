# Training

Train personnel in three different categories:

- Research (called "Researchers" in some documents)
- Production (called "Producers" in some documents)
- Marines/Serfs (the name varies between game versions)

Set the number of personnel to train in each category (up to 100 in a category as mentioned in manual2.txt)

Toggle a lightswitch that appears on the recruiting screen (function unclear - one document suggests it "turns the light on and off" but the actual gameplay effect is not specified)

View trained personnel as they complete training (doors open when training is complete)

Observe personnel's advancement through three ranks/levels as they gain experience (not directly controlled at the training facility, but the ranks are displayed)
