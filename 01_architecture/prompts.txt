So I want us to jointly develop a data model for a Deuteros amiga game remake.

I have provided you with context files in the form of a user-written walkthrough @manual1.txt which contains a complete list of various entities.

Extract all possible game entities from these files as a markdown multi-level list. At this point I just need a reliable list added to 01_architecture/01_game_entities.md

---

Ok, now based on 01_game_entities.md, figure out a list of abstract classes of objects. So for example, I want an abstract `base` but don't want specifically `mars_base`. Produce the list into 01_architecture/02_abstract_entities.md.

---

Now, based on the knowledge from manual1.txt, manual2.txt, and manual_orig.txt, work out entity relationships of the abstract entities in 02_top_level_entities.md.

Make sure the entities are connected with has-one, and has-many relationships. 

Print this into 01_architecture/03_entity_relationships.md.

---

Now, based on 01_game_entities.md, take each of the game entities under `System`, and give them a short summary around what it does in the game based on the provided context files.

Produce that into 04_entity_detail.md

---

Now continue with entities under Location. Add it to 04 file.

---

Now continue with entities under Base. Add it to 04 file.

---

Now do the same with Personnel. Add it to 04

---

And now facility.

---

Now, vehicles.

---

And now for ranks

--- 

Ok, now we will do the same for the equipment, but into the 05_entity_detail_equipment.md file.

---

Perfect. Now let's do resources into 06_entity_detail_resources.md. But I want you to only mention game-related things, not real world knowledge. If you can't find anything in the reference, skip.

I've also added a database of resource abundance in different locations as planetdata.csv.

---

Now, try to work out the major stages in the game progression based on the manuals. These should be based on plot events that lead to the game completion. For now, just list the plot stages in the 01_architecture/07_plot.md file.

---

Ok good, but now update the file and insert a stage between 1 and 2, where you build up your first IOS and set up the moon orbital base and fix the resource base.

---

Now also split up stage 6 into initial expansion to a first other star system, and add a stage after that about continuing into other systems.

---

Ok let's try working on the battle mechanics. Try to describe a battle algorithm based off the available information. 

Note the manual is confusing re the specific numbers, so use only the numbers in 05 for numeric values of drone and fleet power.

The battle algorithm should be written in markdown, do not use any code. Add this content to 01_architecture/08_battle.md.

---

Now based on 08_battle.md information, invent the exact algorithm for calculating battle outcome as a python code block. Add this to 08_battle.

Make sure the battles are always against Methanoids. Stronger fleet should win most of the time, but there should be some randomness involved. Skip torpedo damage for now.

---

OK, focusing on the core battle algorithm described in 08_battle.md (without torpedo effects etc), can you please create a simulator.py, which:

- lists several typical input test cases, including edge ones
- runs the simulation on the test cases many times, producing a statistical result
- prints information about the test case and the outcome in terms of who won, and how many drones remained, preferable in a one-line, \t separated format, for easy reading in the CLI.
