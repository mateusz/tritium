So I want us to jointly develop a data model for a Deuteros amiga game remake.

I have provided you with context files in the form of a user-written walkthrough @manual1.txt which contains a complete list of various entities.

Extract all possible game entities from these files as a markdown multi-level list. At this point I just need a reliable list added to 01_architecture/01_game_entities.md

---

Ok, now based on 01_game_entities.md, figure out a list of abstract classes of objects. So for example, I want an abstract `base` but don't want specifically `mars_base`. Produce the list into 01_architecture/02_abstract_entities.md.

---

Now, based on the knowledge from manual1.txt, manual2.txt, and manual_orig.txt, work out entity relationships of the abstract entities in 02_top_level_entities.md.

Make sure the entities are connected with has-one, and has-many relationships. 

Print this into 01_architecture/03_entity_relationships.md.

---

Now, based on 01_game_entities.md, take each of the game entities under `System`, and give them a short summary around what it does in the game based on the provided context files.

Produce that into 04_entity_detail.md

---

Now continue with entities under Location. Add it to 04 file.

---

Now continue with entities under Base. Add it to 04 file.

---

Now do the same with Personnel. Add it to 04

---

And now facility.

---

Now, vehicles.

---

And now for ranks

--- 

Ok, now we will do the same for the equipment, but into the 05_entity_detail_equipment.md file.

---

Perfect. Now let's do resources into 06_entity_detail_resources.md. But I want you to only mention game-related things, not real world knowledge. If you can't find anything in the reference, skip.

I've also added a database of resource abundance in different locations as planetdata.csv,
