# Research Facility

The Research facility is where scientists develop new technologies and items. Here are all the interactions possible in this facility:

## Interface Elements

- **Research Buttons**: On the right side, buttons show research progress:
  - Green buttons: Items that have already been researched
  - Blue buttons: Items that have not been researched yet
  - Red buttons: Items that cannot be researched, because your researchers have too low rank
  - Yellow buttons: Items in progress (started but not finished)

- **Item Information Display**: When an item is selected, shows:
  - Name of the item
  - Tech level
  - Research progress percentage
  - Once completed: item's mass and required minerals
  - Production location (orbit or Earth)

- **Staff Information**: At the bottom of the screen:
  - Leader's name
  - Leader's rank
  - Number of staff (maximum 250 researchers)

## Actions

- **Select Research Item**: Click on a blue button to begin researching that item.
- **View Research Progress**: Click on a yellow button to view current progress
- **View Completed Research**: Click on a green button to view details of completed research
- **Check Research Item**: Click on a red button to learn what rank is required.


## Notes

- Some items cannot be researched until the research leader advances in rank
- Research teams start with the rank of Technician, then advance to Doctor, and finally Professor
- Higher ranked leaders can research more advanced technologies
- Research progress depends on the number of researchers assigned (maximum 250)
- Research is automatic once assigned - just advance time to see progress
