# Training

Train personnel in three different categories:

- Research
- Production
- Marines

Set the number of personnel to train in each category. Doors close during training and open when finished.

Up to 100 researchers or producers in one elevator batch, but only 41 marines. However, if there is insufficient space either in the hangar, or in the other groups where they could be merged into, it should not be possible to request further training, and the doors of ongoing training should not open until space is made available.

As soon as research personnel is trained, they are added to the researchers already in research facility. This number cannot go above 250, so once trained, this elevator should no longer permit any more training.

As soon as producers are trained, they are added to the producers in the production facility, up to 200.

As soon as marines are trained, the new group is added to the hangar space in the base. There is only 4 slots available. Marine groups are nor merge-able and always function as separate units.

Toggle a lightswitch that appears on the recruiting screen - this is a gimmick, simply turns the light on and off.
