# Resource Entity Details

## Resource (Abstract Base)
The base class for all resources in the game. Resources can be mined using derricks, stored in bases, and transported between locations using ships or mass transceivers.

### Iron
One of the most valuable and essential resources. Found abundantly in the Solar System, particularly on Earth, Moon, Mercury, Mars, Ganymede, and Uranus. Can be mined using derricks (1 ton per day). Required for most manufacturing operations.

### Titanium
Important construction material. Found on several bodies in the Solar System including Earth, Moon, Mercury, and Uranus. Can be mined in the asteroid belt. Resource availability in other star systems is influenced by Solar System colonization choices.

### Aluminum
Critical manufacturing resource. Available on Earth, Moon, Venus, Ganymede, and Callisto in the Solar System. Often becomes rare in other star systems if not properly managed in initial colonization. Can be supplemented using Asteroid Mining Attachments in asteroid belts.

### Copper
Industrial resource found on Mercury, Earth, Callisto, and several other locations. Often found alongside other metal resources.

### Palladium
Rare resource with limited availability. Found on Mercury, Earth, Leda, and several moons in the outer Solar System.

### Platinum
Valuable rare resource. Can be mined in the asteroid belt and found on Venus, Callisto, and several moons.

### Silver
Precious metal found in Mars, several moons, and the asteroid belt. Distribution varies in other star systems.

### Gold
Precious metal with limited availability. Found on Mercury, Himalia, and several other moons.

### Hydrogen
Common gas resource used in fuel production. Found on Venus, Earth, Jupiter, and several other gas giants and moons.

### Helium
Rare gas resource. In the Solar System, only found naturally on Jupiter and Uranus. Required for advanced SCG fuel production.

### Deuterium
Specialized fuel component. Found on Earth, Moon, Europa, and several other moons. Used in advanced fuel production.

### Methane
Gas resource used in fuel production. Found on Venus, Earth, Io, and several moons. Component of MeH fuel.

### Carbon
Common resource found throughout the Solar System. Present on most rocky bodies and moons.

### Silica
Ubiquitous resource found everywhere except Earth. Present on nearly all celestial bodies.

### HydrogenMethanolFuel
Standard fuel (MeH) used by Shuttles and IOS ships. Produced from Hydrogen and Methane. Automatically manufactured when both components are available.

### HeliumDeuteriumFuel
Advanced fuel (HeD) required for SCG ships. Can only be produced at locations with both Helium and Deuterium deposits. Essential for interstellar travel.
