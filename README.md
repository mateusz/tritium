TODO

- add mass to equipment, in case its needed for transport
- problems with equipment costs - the table hasn't been read correctly
- battle at https://youtu.be/e1a-zN6cF-E?si=e4NkqKKtKxlc7jO8&t=1991
- the battles generally you can see going your way or not after first 10 casualties 
- battle 200 vs 170 -> 120 vs 0
- 200 vs 200 -> 111 vs 0 (but next time it went 181 v 189 and player fled)
- 200 vs 189 -> 108 vs 0
- 200 vs 200 -> 99 vs 0
- 200 vs 200 -> 120 vs 0
- generally the player seems to win the 200 v 200 equal battles most of the time
- in battles, generally, when there is 120 vs 20, the 20 dies off very quickly, meaning the more drone advantage there is, the faster the enemy dies off (damage pool assigns to less drones = more kills?)
- the first fleets fighting are weak - 80 drones, then more than a 100, then 200 until destroying the last base in sol, after which I have seen both week and strong attacks - like 19 drones, then 200
